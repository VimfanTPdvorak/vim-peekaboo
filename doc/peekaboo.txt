<leader>vm          n     Stands for View Mode. Set concealcursor to normal,
                          visual, insert, and command line. This means that
                          markup text will remain in its formatted form when the
                          cursor is in the same line in all modes: normal,
                          insert, visual, and command line. This is useful when
                          we only want to view a document with markup text and
                          do not need to see the address of the link.

<leader>em          n     Stands for Edit Mode. Set concealcursor to none. This
                          means that marked-up text will display its actual
                          content when the cursor is located on the same line.
                          This is the default behavior.
