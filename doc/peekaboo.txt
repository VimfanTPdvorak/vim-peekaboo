<leader>vm          n     Stands for View Mode. Set concealcursor to normal,

                          cursor is in the same line in all modes: normal,
                          insert, visual, and command line. This is useful when
                          we only want to view a document with markup text and
                          do not need to see the address of the link.

<leader>em          n     Stands for Edit Mode. Set concealcursor to none. This
                          means that marked-up text will display its actual
                          content when the cursor is located on the same line.
                          This is the default behavior.
